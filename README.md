Demo site of TFA Dev Manager, a Django based web application developed and used by my high school, The Founders Academy.

Everything on this demo site is a 1:1 replica of the main site created and used by my school, aside from the authentication, and database. This demo uses a SQLite Database, while the production version uses Postgres.
